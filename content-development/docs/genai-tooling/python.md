## üíª Exercise

In the following exercise we will use GitHub Copilot to craft a regex, that builds a user object from a string.
Unit tests covering the scenario and validating output are provided.

    The tests are failed for now, let's fix them!

### üîç Code Introduction

In the starting point, you can find the `User` class with a corresponding `UserBuilder` class.

- In `genaitooling/userbuilder.py`, you will find the class `UserBuilder` containing the  method `create_user_with_id` that takes a string as input and returns a `User` object (it raises a `ValueError` in case the input has an incorrect format).
- The input string has the following format: `"Lastname, Firstname (UserId)"` (e.g. `"Doe, John (I012345)"`), where the `UserId` can start with `D` or `I` (both lower and upper case are possible).

Unit tests for the `UserBuilder` class, which are currently failing, are provided. Let's start from there!


### 1 - Find the correct regex using GenAI

1. Use Copilot or the [SAP AI Launchpad](https://sapit-core-playground-vole.ai-launchpad.prod.eu-central-1.aws.apps.ml.hana.ondemand.com/aic/index.html#/generativeaihub?workspace=sap-genai-xl&resourceGroup=default&/g/prompteditor){target=_blank} to craft a working regex for the `USER_ID_REGEX` field of the `UserBuilder` class, in order to fix the failing tests.

    !!! info "Solve this exercise using only LLMs"
        The regex needed here is not too hard to figure out on your own, especially if you already have some experience using regular expressions. Nevertheless, try to solve this exercise using only LLMs.

    !!! tip "Prompt Engineering hints"
        === "SAP AI Launchpad"
            Since the SAP AI Launchpad expects you to converse with the LLM, you need to engineer a prompt telling the GenAI exactly what you want it to do, and what information you expect to receive from it.

            It is important to note that the SAP AI Launchpad lacks the IDE context that Copilot automatically has. Therefore, you need to be very specific and precise when formulating a prompt.

            You may even need to include some snippets from the exercise code to provide more context to the LLM.

            Example

            ```
            As a python developer given is the following class:
            
            class EmailParser:
                EMAIL_REGEX = re.compile(r"TODO")
                
                def parse_email_from_string(self, input: str):
                    matches = EmailParser.EMAIL_REGEX.search(input)
                    
                    if not matches:
                        raise ValueError("Failed to parse the email from the input.")

                    return matches.group(1)
       
            Replace <TODO> with a regular expression that does the following:
            - Match an input string in the form of "Recipient: [EmailAddress]"
            - EmailAddress is a placeholder for an actual string value
            - It is important that the input string as a whole is matched, no partial matches
            - The expected result, when applying the regular expression is that the value for EmailAddress is extracted

            Example input: "Recipient: [doe.john@sap.com]"
            Expected output: "doe.john@sap.com"
            ```

        === "Copilot"
            You can prompt Copilot to suggest code by starting to write and allowing it some time to generate suggestions.

            Another approach is to write a comment explaining the desired behavior or task you want Copilot to assist with.

            Example using a similar scenario

            ```python
            # Given is an input string with the format "Recipient: [doe.john@sap.com]".
            # Create a regular expression that allows to extract the email. Ensure that the string matches as a whole.
            ```

            It is possible that Copilot instead of offering a solution, wants to add another comment.
            ![Copilot suggesting comment](./images/comment-prompt-engineering-issue-python.png)

            In case that happens you need to nudge Copilot by using "leading words", which means start typing code you expect Copilot to pick up on.
            ![Nudging Copilot](./images/comment-prompt-engineering-solution-python.png)


1. Verify that all tests pass after making the change.


### 2 - Extend the behavior

In this step, we want to add a new feature to the `UserBuilder` class.

!!! info "Use the given property and method names"
    It is important that you use the property and method names we list in the following steps.  
    After submitting your solution, we automatically execute smoke tests that rely on these names.  
    When using the [SAP AI Launchpad](https://sapit-core-playground-vole.ai-launchpad.prod.eu-central-1.aws.apps.ml.hana.ondemand.com/aic/index.html#/generativeaihub?workspace=sap-genai-xl&resourceGroup=default&/g/prompteditor){target=_blank} to solve this exercise, please ensure to not blindly copy&paste the code the LLM gives you.

The new method `create_user_with_id_and_name` should allow us to parse the `first_name` and `last_name` from the input string using a new regular expression.

1. Adjust the `User` class. The user should now have additional (optional) string arguments `first_name` and `last_name`. Create the respective getter and setter methods and extend the constructor. In order to not break the existing tests, default the new constructor arguments to `None`
1. Add new tests including assertions for the `user_id`, `first_name` and `last_name` properties. Ensure that the returned `User` object has the `first_name` and `last_name` properties, in addition to the `user_id`.
1. Create the new method `create_user_with_id_and_name` in the `UserBuilder` class.
1. Use Copilot or the [SAP AI Launchpad](https://sapit-core-playground-vole.ai-launchpad.prod.eu-central-1.aws.apps.ml.hana.ondemand.com/aic/index.html#/generativeaihub?workspace=sap-genai-xl&resourceGroup=default&/g/prompteditor){target=_blank} to create a new regex pattern. The pattern should now extract all relevant fields from a string in the format described above (`"Lastname, Firstname (UserId)"`, where the UserId can start with `D` or `I`; don't forget the case insensitivity of the user id).
1. Verify that all tests pass.

## üèÅ Summary

Good job!
In this exercise you wrote code with the help of GenAI and made sure it worked using some tests.

## ü¶Ñ Stretch Goal

We want to know when `User` object instances were created.

- Enhance the `User` class with an additional `created_at` property. Also add getter and setter methods and extend the existing `first_name`, `last_name`, `user_id` constructor.
- Update the existing test cases asserting that `created_at` was set and is not `None`.
- Enhance the `create_user_with_id_and_name` method in the `UserBuilder` class. When a new `User` instance is created set the value of `created_at` to the current date and time formatted the following way: "Thu Nov 23 2023 - 14:28" (representing Thursday, November 23rd 2023 at 2:28PM).

!!! info "Remember to use GenAI"
    As with the previous steps use either GitHub Copilot or the [SAP AI Launchpad](https://sapit-core-playground-vole.ai-launchpad.prod.eu-central-1.aws.apps.ml.hana.ondemand.com/aic/index.html#/generativeaihub?workspace=sap-genai-xl&resourceGroup=default&/g/prompteditor){target=_blank} to provide you with a code snippet formatting the current date and time.
