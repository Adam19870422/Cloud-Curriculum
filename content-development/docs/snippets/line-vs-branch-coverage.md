???info "Line Coverage vs. Branch Coverage"
    Line coverage measures the percentage of lines of code that have been executed during testing.
    It simply checks whether each line of code has been executed at least once.
    This metric tells you how much of your code has been tested, but it doesn't provide information about the different paths your code can take.

    Branch coverage, on the other hand, measures the percentage of branches or decision points in your code that have been executed during testing. 
    A branch is a point in your code where the program can take one of two or more paths based on a condition. 
    Branch coverage checks whether both the true and false branches of each decision point have been executed at least once. 
    This metric gives you a more detailed view of how well your code has been tested, as it captures the different paths your code can take.
