## ðŸ§° Leverage Agile Software Engineering practices

Agile Software Engineering encompasses practices such as test-driven development (TDD), test isolation, refactoring, pair programming and the related tools.
These practices have many proven benefits such as increased quality on all levels, better design, more stable code lines, less integration efforts, much less maintenance efforts and even increased development speed overall.
