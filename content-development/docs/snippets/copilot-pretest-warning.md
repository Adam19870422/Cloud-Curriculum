!!! warning "AI Tooling / GitHub Copilot"

    We understand the temptation to use tools like GitHub Copilot to breeze through this pretest. 
    
    However, **using AI /Copilot is not allowed**.

    **To be clear: The CNDJ is not a language course; we expect you to already have a good grasp of your language/stack.**

    The purpose of this pretest is to **assess your readiness for our training content**; it's a **self-check** tool **for you**, and a way for us to ensure everyone has the **necessary foundation**.

    **If you pass** the pretest, **but have no idea what you are doing**, then you will have a **very hard time** following the training as you will not be able to grasp the concepts and methods we teach. We can't compensate your missing basic knowledge/skills during the trainings!
    
    If you choose to ignore this advice, it's your decision. We're here to help you learn, but the ultimate responsibility for your learning journey lies with you.
