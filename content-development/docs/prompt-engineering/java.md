## üíª Exercise

In this exercise we will add an "auto-fill" feature to a bulletin board application used for creating advertisements. It will enable users of the web UI to have information such as description, price, and currency automatically suggested through the use of a LLM. To achieve this, we will need to engineer a "system prompt".

### üîç Code Introduction

We provide a stripped down version of a bulletin board application, allowing users to post classified ads.

The app has:

- a working integration with the [BTP service proxy for third-party LLM APIs](https://github.tools.sap/I057149/azure-openai-service#readme){target=_blank}
- a UI that can be accessed from `http://localhost:8080` when the application is started
- a `@RestController` in the class `AdvertisementController`, that provides an endpoint to be called when the auto-fill button on the UI is clicked
- a `system.prompt` file in the `src/main/resources` directory, which will be the only file we will be touching in this exercise

!!! warning "No changes to the provided Java code are required"
	The provided application is functional and requires no changes to the Java code or configuration, except for the modifications to the `system.prompt` file, as specified in the exercise instructions.

### 1 - Start the app and have a look

Let's familiarize ourselves with the application.

1. Check that the tests are working, by running `mvn clean verify`. All tests should pass.

1. Now that the app builds, you can start it using `mvn spring-boot:run` or start it directly in our IDE.

1. Take a look around and familiarize yourself with the UI, which you can reach at `http://localhost:8080`.

	![](./images/bbadsui.png){ style="border: 2px solid  gray; border-radius:15px" }

	As far as functions go:

	| Button   | Function  |
	|:-------:|:------|
	| ![](./images/magnifying-glass.gif ) | Triggers the auto-fill feature, which automatically populates other fields based on the content of the `title` field. ‚ö†Ô∏è Trying to use the auto-fill function will result in an error, since you have not yet specified an actual prompt that can be processed by the application. |
	| ![](./images/save.gif) | *Intentionally disabled* since it is not applicable for this exercise.      |
	| ![](./images/cancel.gif) | Clears all input fields, removing any data entered. |

### 2 - Engineering a prompt

Before integrating a prompt into the application, we'll practice some prompt engineering techniques using the [Playground for Large Language Models](https://ai-playground.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com/index.html){target=_blank}.

1. To get going, let's define what the auto-fill feature should do:

	- The prompt should retrieve the following item information:
		- Description
		- Price
		- Currency  
	
	- The prompt should consist of two parts:
		- System prompt: This part defines what needs to be fetched
		- User prompt: This part represents input from the user, in our case the content of the `Title` field

	- The prompt should return a `JSON` object in the following format
		```json
		{
			"description": "The Description",
			"price": 123,
			"currency": "The Currency"
		}
		```

1. Use the [Playground for Large Language Models](https://ai-playground.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com/index.html){target=_blank} to create a `system prompt` that fulfills the requirements. Please note that the LLM integration in the provided bulletin board app uses the `gpt-35-turbo` model, therefore we recommend utilizing this model to refine your prompt as well.

1. Add your `system prompt` (without the `user prompt` part!) to the `system.prompt` file in `src/main/resources`


??? example "Need help?"
	Here is an example prompt using a book store as an example:
	```console linenums="1"
	Given is a book title delimited by <>.
	Return the author and a short summary of the book.
	Format the response in json using the following keys: "author", "summary".

	<The Lord of the Rings>
	```

	In this example, lines 1-3 resemble the `system prompt`, which you are engineering, and line 5 is the `user prompt` which comes from the user at runtime.

	A response to a prompt like this then could like the following:
	```json
	{
		"author": "J.R.R. Tolkien",
		"summary": "The Lord of the Rings is a high fantasy novel that follows the journey of a group of characters as they attempt to destroy a powerful ring and defeat the Dark Lord Sauron. Set in the fictional world of Middle-earth, the book explores themes of friendship, heroism, and the struggle between good and evil."
	}
	```

??? info "Hallucinations"
	When asking an LLM for information about a topic, there is a chance that the LLM may hallucinate and provide factually incorrect answers.  
	To minimize "hallucinations", it is recommended to ask for information that the LLM is likely to possess.
	For example, in the context of the previous example involving a bookstore, asking the LLM about a recently released book will likely result in hallucinations, as the LLM does not yet have access to that information and may therefore fabricate it.  
	It's crucial to remember that an LLM's answer can be very convincing, even when it is entirely false. Therefore, it is always wise to "**trust, but verify**" the information provided by the LLM.

### 3 - Iterate and Evolve

Are you satisfied with the prompt you've created, or is there room for improvement?

What about the description? : 

- is it too long? 
- does it contain inaccurate or false information?
- is the price appropriate for the item you are attempting to sell?

To improve the prompt used in the application, you can apply additional prompt engineering techniques to iterate and refine it.

### 3.1 Be specific and precise

When designing a prompt to retrieve information about a specific topic, it is helpful to provide a precise description of the required information.  

Adapt your `system prompt` to:

1. limit the length of the returned description
1. have the LLM return the currency in the [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217){target=_blank} format (3 letter abbreviation, for example EUR instead of Euro). 

??? example "Need help?"
	Example:
	```console
	Given is a book title delimited by <>.
	Return the author and a short summary of the book.
	Ensure that the summary consists of 2 short sentences at most.
	Write the summary as if it was published in a book report of a newspaper.
	The authors name should have the format of Lastname, Firstname.

	<The Lord of the Rings>
	```


### 3.2 Setting a Context and Role

Often it can be helpful to refine a prompt by establishing a context in which the LLM agent should answer the question.  
Additionally, defining the role that the LLM agent should adopt can further ensure that the answers are more closely related to your expectations.

Apply this principle to your prompt in order to explore how different perspectives can impact the information generated by the LLM by:

1. asking the LLM to take the role of a retailer (to influence the price)
1. asking the LLM to take the role of a technical writer (to pivot the item description in a more technical direction)

??? example "Need help?"
	```console
	As a librarian, you have been assigned the task of updating
	the library's catalogue by adding information to the existing books.
	...
	```

### 3.3 One-Shot/Few-Shot Prompting

One-Shot or Few-Shot prompting is a technique where you provide examples of what you expect in your answer.  
These examples serve as a form of in-context learning for the LLM and can help steer the output in the right direction. 

1. Enhance your prompt by giving an example of the desired description

??? example "Need help?"
	Example:
	```console
	Given is a book title delimited by <>.
	Return the author and a short summary of the book.

	For example:
	For the book "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" the following information is correct
	Author: Adams, Douglas
	Summary: The plot of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" follows events in the life of Arthur Dent, a man who lives on Earth in England. He is whisked off into an adventure in space by his friend Ford Prefect (who is from another planet) who tells him that Earth is about to be destroyed.

	<The Lord of the Rings>
	```

### 3.4 Restrictions and Boundaries

To further mitigate hallucinations, one approach is to establish clear limits and boundaries on the data utilization of an LLM.  
While not guaranteed, it can encourage the LLM to retrieve data from trusted sources.

1. Restrict the data retrieval for the LLM to use only prices from amazon.com

??? example "Need help?"
	Example:
	```console
	Given is a book title delimited by <>.
	Return the author and a short summary of the book.
	Only use information from bookstores, Amazon and other retail shops as sources.

	<The Lord of the Rings>
	```

### 3.5 Ask the LLM for Help

You can use the LLM's capabilities to help you refine your prompt.  
It can help to start with a simple prompt expressing what it is you want to do and have the LLM suggest improvements.  
Then building on these improvements, do multiple iterations until you arrive at a level you think is right.

Question
```console
I want to write a prompt that returns the author and a short, concise summary of a given book title.
What is a prompt that enables me to do this?
```

Potential answer
```console
Sure! Here's a prompt that you can use to retrieve the author and a short summary of a given book title:

Given a book title, return the author and a concise summary of the book.

**Prompt**
Book Title: {book_title}

**Examples**
Input: "To Kill a Mockingbird"
Output: 
Author: Harper Lee
Summary: "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a classic novel written by Harper Lee. Set in the 1930s in a small town in Alabama, the story revolves around racial injustice and the moral growth of the young protagonist, Scout Finch.

Input: "1984"
Output: 
Author: George Orwell
Summary: "1984" is a dystopian novel written by George Orwell. It portrays a totalitarian society where the government controls every aspect of people's lives, and the protagonist, Winston Smith, rebels against the oppressive regime.

Input: "Pride and Prejudice"
Output: 
Author: Jane Austen
Summary: "Pride and Prejudice" is a beloved novel written by Jane Austen. Set in 19th-century England, the story follows the protagonist, Elizabeth Bennet, as she navigates societal expectations, love, and the complexities of class.

**Note**
- Assume that the book titles provided are well-known and have widely recognized authors.
- The summary should be a concise description of the book's main themes or plot.
- The output format should include the author's name and a short summary of the book.

Feel free to modify the examples or add more details to the prompt as needed.
```

Refinement Possibility
```console
Following is a prompt which needs to be enhanced by returning json including the author and summary. Also the description should be max 2 sentences long and the author should have the format Firstname, Lastname.

Rewrite the prompt to incorporate those changes.
...
```

### 4 - Use your Prompt

1. Save your prompt in the `system.prompt` file mentioned earlier
1. Build the application and ensure the test cases are passing
1. Start the application
1. Manually Test the application

Your prompt, as specified in `system.prompt`, will be automatically supplemented with the title of the item entered in the UI when the magnifying glass icon is used to send the request to the application.

!!! warning "Your prompt does not work?"
	In case the prompt caused an error in the application, for example, an error message is displayed in the UI, check the logs to figure out what went wrong.  
	Maybe the returned JSON format is incorrect or includes data that can't be deserialized?"

## üèÅ Summary

Good job!  
During this exercise, you utilized common prompt engineering techniques to design a prompt for a bulletin board application integrated with an LLM. This prompt enables the implementation of a feature that automatically populates fields in the UI.

## ü¶Ñ Stretch Goals

If you want to get more hands-on experience with the actual Java code, take a look at the `com.sap.bulletinboard.ads.services.llm` package.

1. Use a different LLM instead of `gpt-35-turbo` (see [BTP service proxy for third-party LLM APIs](https://github.tools.sap/I057149/azure-openai-service#readme){target=_blank}
1. Implement new LLM request and response beans (see [Sample Code](https://github.tools.sap/I057149/azure-openai-service/blob/master/samples/getting-started.py){target=_blank} for what might be required)
1. Update the `LiveLLMServiceClient` utilizing the new request and response beans
1. Experiment with prompt `temperature`
