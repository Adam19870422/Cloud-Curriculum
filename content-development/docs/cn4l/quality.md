## ü§î Wait, but why?

Product Quality is much more than just functional correctness.

- You should be aware of various quality aspects, e.g. "service quality" which is highly relevant in the cloud.
- In addition, there are "internal qualities" which will affect the productivity of your organization.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

In this module you will learn

- what the different quality aspects are
- how quality impacts productivity
- which metrics measure quality well
- how you can help your teams and organization to improve quality

## üß† Theory

1. Check out the slides on [Software Quality](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/AllLanguages/softwareQuality-slides/index.html){target=_blank} ([with speaker notes](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/AllLanguages/softwareQuality-slides/index.html?showNotes=true){target=_blank}) or the [recording](https://video.sap.com/media/t/1_ocrkr28w){target=_blank}.

1. Learn about [Why Clean Code matters](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/AllLanguages/cleanCode-slides/index-principles.html?tags=java#/0/1){target=_blank} ([with speaker notes](https://pages.github.tools.sap/EngineeringCulture/ase/AllLanguages/cleanCode-slides/index-principles.html?showNotes=true&tags=java#/0/1){target=_blank}), which is fundamental in order to achieve high software quality, **on this single slide**.

1. *Stretch Goal:* Watch the full [Clean Code Presentation (16min)](https://video.sap.com/media/t/1_ljkfkbzr){target=_blank}, to get an idea of what "good" looks like, and understand that it takes deliberate effort to do things "right".

## üèÜ Case Study

1. Watch this talk by Bela Tolvaj at d<kom\> 2020, on [***how IBP achieved High Quality & Low TCO during a high growth phase*** (40min)](https://broadcast.sap.com/event/dkom/2020#!video%2F20124){target=_blank}, and have a look at the [slides](./resources/SAP_IBP_High_Quality_Low_TCO.pdf){target=_blank}. SAP Integrated Business Planning (IBP) is a highly successful SAP product.

## ü™û Reflections

1. Think about a **product or service you are in charge of**, then answer the following question:

    <table>
    <tr>
        <th colspan="2">In which of the following areas/qualities do you see the biggest improvement potential?</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Adoption</td>
        <td>Performance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Availability</td>
        <td>Scalability</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Deployments</td>
        <td>Security</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Functional Correctness</td>
        <td>Service & Support</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Innovation Speed</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    </table>

    ???info "Your peers[^1] chose the following areas/qualities"
        <table>
        <tr>
            <td>1.</td>
            <td>Innovation Speed</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2.</td>
            <td>Adoption</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3.</td>
            <td>Performance</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4.</td>
            <td>Scalability & Deployments</td>
        </tr>
        </table>

## üíª Technical Exercises
Before you move on to the next module, ensure that you:

1. fulfill the [technical prerequisites](https://pages.github.tools.sap/cloud-curriculum/materials/leaders/cn4l/prerequisites/)
1. are comfortable with the [language and stack basics](https://pages.github.tools.sap/cloud-curriculum/materials/leaders/cn4l/stack-basics/) for the stack of your choice (Java, TypeScript on Node.js, or Python)

## ‚úèÔ∏è Non-Technical Exercises

1. Gather your organizations current goals (or perhaps you use [OKRs](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_Key_Results){target=_blank}?) and metrics.

    Reflect with a **colleague or team member** on the following questions:

    1. Are your goals or OKRs ["SMART"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)
    1. Can you measure whether you are succeeding or failing?
    1. How can you determine whether you can celebrate at the end of a quarter?


1. Goals are often defined in a way that makes measuring success difficult.

    Reflect with your **team** on the metrics you use, and how these relate to your goals:

    1. What metrics do you use?
    1. Which metrics are useful and have triggered actions in the past?
    1. Are some metrics missing? What should you measure in addition?
    1. Which metrics can be cheated?
        1. Can you prevent this?
        1. Could a different metric more effectively measure the desired outcome?
    1. Is the data quality of your metrics sufficient?
    1. How could you improve your metrics to be more *outcome-oriented* and less output-oriented?
