## ü§î Wait, but why?

Agile Software Engineering (ASE) includes practices such as Test-Driven Development (TDD), Test isolation, Refactoring, and Pair Programming.

These practices have proven benefits, such as:

- Increased quality on all levels
- Better design
- More stable codebases
- Lower integration efforts
- Significantly lower maintenance efforts
- Increased development speed overall

## üéØ Learning Objectives

In this module you will learn:

- About ASE practices and how they benefit your teams
- How to design a test strategy
- How to design and write unit tests
- How Test-Driven Development works and why it is so important
- How Pair Programming adds value to team culture
- How effective pairing is with an AI

## üèÜ Case Studies

1. SAP introduced Agile Software Engineering in 2010 and has been training engineers in ASE ever since. Read from J√ºrgen Heymann, one of our leading experts, about [how SAP introduced Agile Software Engineering practices in development](https://community.sap.com/t5/application-development-blog-posts/introducing-agile-software-engineering-in-development/ba-p/13350802){target=_blank}. You will also learn what you can do as a leader, and why this is important.

1. Learn how Agile practices are applied in Azure DevOps teams in this [talk (40min)](https://video.sap.com/media/1_hnah2z60) by Donovan Brown from Microsoft.


## ü™û Reflections

1. What is your role in all of this?
1. How can you influence or change the team culture?
1. How do you personally "pair" with peers or team members?


## üíª Technical Exercises

Complete the following exercises:

1. **Mandatory: Test-Driven Development (TDD)** using
    [Java](https://pages.github.tools.sap/cloud-curriculum/materials/leaders/test-driven-development/java/){target=_blank},
    [Node.js](https://pages.github.tools.sap/cloud-curriculum/materials/leaders/test-driven-development/nodejs/){target=_blank} or
    [Python](https://pages.github.tools.sap/cloud-curriculum/materials/leaders/test-driven-development/python/){target=_blank}


    We particularly recommend TDD because it:

    - Is essential to establish a safety net for your cloud applications
    - Helps in refining large stories
    - Eases regression testing

1. *Stretch*: Unit Testing using
    [Java](https://pages.github.tools.sap/cloud-curriculum/materials/leaders/unit-testing/java/){target=_blank},
    [Node.js](https://pages.github.tools.sap/cloud-curriculum/materials/leaders/unit-testing/nodejs/){target=_blank} or
    [Python](https://pages.github.tools.sap/cloud-curriculum/materials/leaders/unit-testing/python/){target=_blank}

1. *Stretch*: GenAI Tooling using
    [Java](https://pages.github.tools.sap/cloud-curriculum/materials/leaders/genai-tooling/java/){target=_blank},
    [Node.js](https://pages.github.tools.sap/cloud-curriculum/materials/leaders/genai-tooling/nodejs/){target=_blank} or
    [Python](https://pages.github.tools.sap/cloud-curriculum/materials/leaders/genai-tooling/python/){target=_blank}



Once you submit your solution, you will receive automated feedback on whether you passed the exercise.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Non-Technical Exercises

1. Typically, teams struggle with technical debt or legacy code.
    1. Do your teams work on legacy code?
    1. What is your strategy to reduce technical debt?

<!-- TODO: How can learners document their legacy code strategy? Mural? -->
