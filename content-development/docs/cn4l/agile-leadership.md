## ü§î Wait, but why?

- Leaders play a crucial role in supporting and sustaining agile methodologies and Agile Software Engineering practices.

- Leaders must be committed to empower their teams to do the "right thing", rather than just focusing on rapidly delivering features while accumulating technical debt due to business pressures.
