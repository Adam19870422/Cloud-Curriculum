Being successful in the Cloud requires overcoming the friction between development and operations in order to foster business agility: you build it, and you run it. It's about high automation, short innovation cycles, transparency on application health and feature usage, and collaboration.

Cloud engineering is a multidisciplinary field that focuses on the design, development and operation of applications based on cloud computing models. It encompasses practices such as software architecture, containerization and virtualization, cloud platforms, continuous delivery, and many concepts in DevOps.

Cloud Engineering aims to improve efficiency and reduce cost for organizations of all sizes. By applying its practices, development teams can build applications with high scalability and availability, but low business overhead.
