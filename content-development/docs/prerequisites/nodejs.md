# üß∞ Technical Prerequisites

You will need a few things in order to work with the exercises.

## üõ†Ô∏è Bare minimum

- [**Git** client](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git){target=_blank}

- A terminal (on Windows, use git bash which comes with Git client)

- [**Node.js** LTS (22.x) with **NPM** (>=9)](https://nodejs.org/en/download){target=_blank}

    - If you need to manage *multiple* versions of **`node`** and / or **`npm`**, consider using a [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/npm/cli#node-version-managers){target=_blank}.

- **IDE** of your choice

    - We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){target=_blank} with [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig){target=_blank} and [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint){target=_blank} extensions installed for the best developer experience throughout the exercises.

Note that some of the exercises may have additional prerequisites, as listed in the corresponding exercise description.

## üê≥ Docker

Even though you do not need <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">**Docker**</a> from the start (it will only become mandatory in the _Cloud Development_ part) we still would like to mention it here since you need to buy an additional license for it:
