# üß∞ Technical Prerequisites

You will need a few things in order to work with the exercises.

## üõ†Ô∏è Bare minimum

- **IDE** e.g. [IntelliJ Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/){target=_blank}/[Spring Tool Suite](https://spring.io/tools){target=_blank}/[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com){target=_blank}
- [**Java JDK** 17 or 21](https://sap.github.io/SapMachine/#download){target=_blank}
- [**Maven**](https://maven.apache.org/){target=_blank}
- [**Git client**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git){target=_blank}
- A terminal (on Windows, use git bash which comes with Git client)

Note that some of the exercises may have additional prerequisites, as listed in the corresponding exercise description.

## üê≥ Docker

Even though you do not need <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">**Docker**</a> from the start (it will only become mandatory in the _Cloud Development_ part) we still would like to mention it here since you need to buy an additional license for it:

{% include 'snippets/docker.md' %}
