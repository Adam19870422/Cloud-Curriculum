## Skillcheck

We recommend that you complete the [Prerequisite Test](../../pretest/ase-{{language|lower|replace(".","")}}/){target=_blank} to check that you already have the required skills.
In case you struggle, please check our recommended list of [{{language}} Language & Stack Basics](../../stack-basics/{{language|lower|replace(".","")}}/){target=_blank} that should help you to pass the test.

## How to work and stay motivated

- We recommend that you explore the option of [finding a learning partner](https://fiorilaunchpad.sap.com/sites#my-events&/ig=12630033){target=_blank} to enhance your learning experience.
- We propose you block some time in your calendar of 1-2 hours per day or multiple times per week.
- Itâ€™s good to set yourself mini goals for each week (e.g. finish X module(s) per week)

## Guidance on how to complete self-learning

Start your Cloud Native Developer Journey with guided exercises:

1. Ensure you have all [technical prerequisites](../../prerequisites/{{language|lower|replace(".","")}}/){target=_blank}
1. The '[Learner Steps](https://cloud-native-developer-journey.cfapps.eu12.hana.ondemand.com/){target=_blank}' table on the sign-up page allows you to track your progress.<br/>
    Please self-report the theory parts by checking the corresponding boxes.
    Once you have finished and pushed an exercise, the submission and validation status will shown in the learner steps list. Note that the synch might take ~30 minutes.

    For the exercises which have CF and K8s variations you are only expected to complete one or the other e.g. 'Continuous Delivery (Cloud Foundry)' **OR** 'Continuous Delivery (Kubernetes)'.

1. Once you are finished with the "Implement Bulletinboard Ads Application (Exercise Assigment)..." your submission will be validated (as with the other exercises) and upon passing you will then be eligible to attend for a Cloud Native Bootcamp training.

Afterwards we will celebrate your success and your Cloud Native Developer Badge together!
