## üéØ Learning Objectives

In this module you will learn

- how to design good Unit tests
- how to run Unit tests in your IDE or via command line and evaluate the test coverage
- how to write Unit tests for an existing codebase

## üíª Exercise
It is your task to add unit tests for the class `NumberConverter`.

{% include 'snippets/prerequisites/python.md' %}
{% endwith %}


### üöÄ Getting Started

{% with branch_name="unit-testing", folder_name="unit-testing-python" %}
{% include 'snippets/clone-import/python.md' %}
{% endwith %}

{% with folder_name="unit-testing-python" %}
{% include 'snippets/python-create-use-virtual-env.md' %}
{% endwith %}

{% include 'snippets/install-dependencies/python.md' %}

{% include 'snippets/run-tests/run-tests-aggregate-python.md' %}

    If the tests were successful you should see the following logs in the console:

    ```logtalk
    ====== test session starts ======
    <...>
    collected 1 item                                                                                           

    tests/test_number_converter.py .                                                                     [100%]

    ====== 1 passed in 0.02s =======
    ```

### üîç Code Introduction


- In `unit_testing/number_converter.py` you will find the class `NumberConverter`, containing the method `roman_to_arabic(self, roman_numeral: str)` which takes the `self` representing current instance of the class and roman numeral as parameters and, after conversion, returns an arabic integer.

- There is also the stub of a test class in the corresponding test path `tests/test_number_converter.py` that:
    - has a field of type `NumberConverter` that is instantiated in the method `number_converter` annotated with `@pytest.fixture` - this means that any method using `number_converter` in their parameters will automatically instantiate our class under test (`NumberConverter`) before its execution
    - contains a first simple Pytest test method called `test_example`.
    - has `assert` imported and ready to use.



### 0 - Check Coverage

If you like, you can check the initial test coverage before we begin:

=== "Command line"
{% filter indent(4) %}
{% with folder_name="unit_testing" %}
{% include 'snippets/run-test-coverage/pytest-cli-test-coverage.md' %}
{% endwith %}
{% endfilter %}
=== "Visual Studio"
{% filter indent(4) %}
{% include 'snippets/run-test-coverage/pytest-vs-test-coverage.md' %}
{% endfilter %}
=== "PyCharm (Professional)"
{% filter indent(4) %}
{% include 'snippets/run-test-coverage/pytest-pycharm-test-coverage.md' %}
{% endfilter %}

???info "Configuration file `pytest.ini`"
    The `pytest.ini` file is a configuration file for pytest. It can be used to set various options for pytest, such as the test paths, the test files to ignore, the test coverage settings, etc. We can create a `pytest.ini` file in the root directory of our project and add the following content:

    ```ini
    [pytest]
    addopts = --cov=unit_testing --cov-report=html
    ```

    - `addopts`: allows us to pass additional options to pytest. Meaning, when we run `pytest`, it will use the options specified in the `addopts` option.  
    - `--cov`: specifies the path to the module you want to measure coverage for.  
    - `--cov-report`: specifies the type of coverage report you want to generate.
    In this case, we are generating an HTML report in the `coverage_html_report` folder.

    You can find more information about the available options in the [pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/customize.html#pytest-ini){target=_blank}.

Depending on your IDE and your settings, the coverage report will show you the line (and branch)-coverage of your code.
???info "Line Coverage vs. Branch Coverage"
    Line coverage measures the percentage of lines of code that have been executed during testing.
    It simply checks whether each line of code has been executed at least once.
    This metric tells you how much of your code has been tested, but it doesn't provide information about the different paths your code can take.

    Branch coverage, on the other hand, measures the percentage of branches or decision points in your code that have been executed during testing.
    A branch is a point in your code where the program can take one of two or more paths based on a condition.
    Branch coverage checks whether both the true and false branches of each decision point have been executed at least once.
    This metric gives you a more detailed view of how well your code has been tested, as it captures the different paths your code can take.



Now let's write some tests!
**Execute the tests after each change you make!**







### 1 - Single Roman Numerals

First, let's write some simple test cases for the "Happy Path".

1. Start with single digit roman numerals, here are some examples:
    - `I` should return `1`
    - `V` should return `5`
    - `M` should return `1000`

    ??? example "Need help?"
        A typical assertion within a test method might look like this:
        ```python
        assert number_converter.roman_to_arabic("X") == 10
        ```


    !!! info "Naming conventions for unit test methods"
        - Be aware that all methods names in Python should begin with "test" in order to be detected by pytest 
        - There are some popular [naming conventions for test methods](https://dzone.com/articles/7-popular-unit-test-naming){target=_blank}, like "Given-When-Then" or "Should_ExpectedBehavior_When_StateUnderTest".
        - You may pick any convention you feel comfortable with, but you should use it consistently in your code.


    !!! info "Granularity of test methods"
        - You can either add several tests methods with one assertion each or create one assertion made by concatenating many boolean results using operator "and"
        ```python
        assert  number_converter.roman_to_arabic("i") == 1 and \
                number_converter.roman_to_arabic("I") == 1
        ```
        - Both approaches are fine, as long as you don't bundle unrelated requirements (e.g. single digit roman numerals and subtractive numerals) into the same test method.
        - Keeping unrelated requirements separated keeps the tests small, and focused on one aspect, thus making them easier to read, maintain and understand.

1. Add more test cases until you feel comfortable!



### 2 - Invalid Numerals

As a next step, we want to test the most important "Error Paths".

- Add test cases that assert that `-1` is returned in case invalid parameters are provided such as:
    - numerals that are not existing
    - empty strings
    - null values
    - combinations of numerals that are not allowed

### 3 - Additive and Subtractive Numerals

Now let's make it more complex: In the roman numeration, literals can be additive and subtractive.

1. Add some test cases for valid additive roman numerals, e.g.:
    - `II`
    - `VI`
    - `CXI`

1. Also add some test cases for valid subtractive roman numerals, like
    - `IV`
    - `XL`
    - `XC`

1. Add more test cases until you feel comfortable with your test suite for additive and subtractive numerals.

### 4 - Complex Numerals

1. If not done already, extend your test suite with test cases for more complex roman numerals, such as:
    - `XIV`
    - `CMXL`
    - `MMXXI`
1. Once you've added a few cases, execute the tests with test coverage tracking again.
1. Have a look at the coverage report for `NumberConverter` and check if there are any chunks of code you have missed so far.
1. Think about relevant test cases to cover the missing code and add them. You may also add some more complex equivalent test cases to the previous steps.

!!! info "The Value of Test Coverage..."
    - A high test coverage doesn't automatically mean your test suite is sufficient, it is a great tool to help you to find the spots you've missed though.
    - Remember, high test coverage is a **necessary**, but **not a sufficient** identifier of a healthy codebase.
    - You could easily write tests to achieve high coverage without actually making any assertions about the outcome, thus testing nothing except that no exceptions are thrown. This is a behavior which can often be seen if Test Coverage is used as a KPI by management without granting the time/resources to actually do things right.
    - Use test coverage as what it is: a high level indicator, not a KPI.
