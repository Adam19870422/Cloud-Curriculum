## What Can I Find Here?

On this page you will find various learning topics that are part of the [Cloud Native Developer Journey](https://sap.sharepoint.com/sites/126802/SitePages/Cloud-Native-Developer-Journey.aspx){target=_blank}.

## Navigation & Content
Choose your language from the top menu bar and then simply navigate through the menu on the left to find the topic you are interested in.

## Order of Modules
The modules follow a logical order and represent a recommended path trough the content:

- If you are new to the **Language & Stack** we recommend you learn the basics first (curated link list, mostly Pluralsight)
- Once you know the language and its toolset, work through the **Software Crafts(wo)manship** modules to learn how to write clean, testable and maintainable code
- Next you can have a look at the **Cloud Development** modules to learn how to create, deploy, monitor and connect microservices. There is also a focus on microservice tradeoffs
- The **Appendix** contains additional material which might help you in your daily work later on


## Found Errors/Issues?
Click on the Github icon at the top right of the menu bar to visit our github repo and create a Github issue there.

_Happy learning!_
