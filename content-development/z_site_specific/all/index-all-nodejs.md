## What Can I Find Here?

Here you'll find engineering learning modules, starting from basic concepts to advanced practitioner. They are suitable for self-paced learners and include theory and hands-on exercises.

If you're interested in cohort-based curriculum check out the [**Cloud Native Developer Journey**](https://sap.sharepoint.com/sites/126802/SitePages/Cloud-Native-Developer-Journey.aspx){target=_blank}.

## Order & Categorization

Modules can be consumed individually, based your learning need. To help you orienting, they are ordered from "basic" to "advanced" and categorized as follows:

- If you are new to the the language and stack, check the **Prerequisites** first
- **Software Craftsmanship** is about writing clean, testable and maintainable code
- In **Cloud Engineering** you'll learn to develop _and_ operate cloud-native solutions
